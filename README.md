### Hi there 👋

I'm Devin! After a decade of working as a video editor in advertising agencies and freelance roles serving established brands and startups, I'm pursuing a career pivot into software engineering. 

My background as an exhaustive researcher, love of precision, and experience in creative problem-solving has drawn me to this exciting career path. Crafting bespoke solutions for clients and taking direction from top creative talent has prepared me to excel in collaborative engineering settings along with my skills in communicating technical requirements to non-technical audiences.

As a software engineer, I’m interested in creating accessible applications that target the needs of non-traditional users and, in turn, benefit all users.
